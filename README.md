# Weather Comparison

This is a simple web application that shows the current weather compared to yesterday's forecast for a given city.

The application was built step by step with the help of a large language model trained by OpenAI ([ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)).

The application retrieves the forecast data from a weather API and displays it in the user's web browser.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
To run this application, you will need:

- A web browser
- An internet connection
- An API key for a weather API (e.g. openweathermap.org)

### Installing
To install the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
1. Replace the `API_KEY` placeholder in the `main.js` file with your own API key.

### Usage
